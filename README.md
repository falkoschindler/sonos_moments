# Sonos Moments

This is a simple web application based on [SoCo](https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo/) and [NiceGUI](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui) to control Sonos speakers in a local network.
Its main feature is to capture "moments", i.e. the current state of the speakers, and to restore them later.
This way, you can easily switch between different scenarios, e.g. your favorite radio station during breakfast in the kitchen, a relaxing playlist in the living room, or a party mix in the garden - all without having to use the original Sonos app.
Especially since their latest update, the Sonos app has become quite bloated and slow, so this is a lightweight alternative for those who just want to control their speakers.
